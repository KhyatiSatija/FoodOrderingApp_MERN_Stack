# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Concepts Used
- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Bootstrap 5**: A popular CSS framework for building responsive and mobile-first websites.
- **Node.js**: A JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine for server-side development.
- **Express.js**: A minimalist web framework for Node.js used for building APIs and web applications.
- **MongoDB Atlas**: A fully managed cloud database service provided by MongoDB.
- **Mongoose**: An Object Data Modeling (ODM) library for MongoDB and Node.js.
- **Nodemon**: A tool that helps in automatically restarting the server when changes are made to the source code.
- **React Router DOM**: A library for routing in React applications, enabling navigation between different components.
- **Express Validator**: A middleware for Express.js used for data validation.
- **bcrypt.js**: A library for hashing passwords in Node.js.
- **jsonwebtoken**: A library for generating JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for user authentication.
- **useReducer, hooks, props, states**: React features for managing state and data flow in components.
- **Context API**: A React feature for sharing state between components without having to pass props through every level of the component tree.


## Installation

### `git clone https://github.com/KhyatiSatija/FoodOrderingApp_MERN_Stack.git`

In the project directory `client`, you can run:

### `npm install`

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

Go to the backend folder and run:
### `nodemon index.js`


## Available Scripts
The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
